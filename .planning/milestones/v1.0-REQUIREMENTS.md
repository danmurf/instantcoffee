## v2 Requirements

### Input Modes

- **VOICE-01**: User can speak instead of type for diagram requests
- **VOICE-02**: Speech converted to text for AI processing

### Advanced Features

- **TPLT-01**: User can select from diagram templates for quick starts

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Real-time multi-user collaboration | Contradicts local-first principle, adds massive complexity |
| Cloud deployment | Local POC first, cloud optional future |
| Mobile app | Web-only for v1 |
| Plugin/extension system | Adds unnecessary complexity for POC |
| Cloud sync | Contradicts local-first principle |
