# Instant Coffee

I want to build a tool called Instant Coffee which facilitates a whiteboarding session. There should be a chat interface and a whiteboard. The user starts talking into the chat box, and Instant Coffee has the pen in hand, updating the whiteboard as the discussion unfolds. In the background, Instant Coffee will be creating/updating a D2 document, and between each iteration, the document should be rendered on the screen. The user says something like, I want to design an async process for processing payments. Instant Coffee writes up a sequence diagram for an async processing flow. The user says something related to what they see, saying exactly how they want it to be updated. Instant Coffee makes the update. The iteration process should be quick and fluid, allowing the user to say what they want and the diagram to be updated, until they have a diagram explaining exactly what they need. This isn't limited to sequence diagrams, it could be ERDs, architectural designs, anything that can be done with D2 (Instant Coffee should know all of the capabilities and always pick the best tool). It should allow text based updates, or voice based. Everything should be able to run locally, using Ollama. The diagram rendering should happen locally. The user should be able to easily spin up Instant Coffee, open it in a web browser, and start working. The design should be simple, modern, and beautiful. Looking like a modern SaaS product. When the user is happy, they should be able to save the diagram, and also save the state of the session, so they can start a new session with a clean slate, and come back to this later if they choose. Instant Coffee should also learn about the system they are working with over time. FOr example, you should be able to tell instant coffee about the different service names, what they do, which team owns them, etc, and it should remember all of these details in a semantic database. The next time you come back to have a discussion, it should draw from its knowledge of your system. There should be a way to manage what it knows. This means there are two main features; knowledge and diagraming. The system could also be asked questions so it can give its opinion. It's like the ultimate pair programmer buddy, where you work through problems together, but it eventually knows everything about your system, based on your conversations, and it's great at diagraming.

In terms of the tech stack, I have no preference for this. Please pick what you think is best. Initially, I would like this to be a local tool, but eventually it may be something online. Let's make it run locally as a POC first.
